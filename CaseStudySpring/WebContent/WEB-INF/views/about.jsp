	<p>Hi Everyone,</p><br>
	
	<p>My name is Ann Uduc.  I am a licensed real estate sales agent at Showcase Realty.  
	I am specialized in sales and rentals in all of New York City, but especially in Queens NY.  
	I have created this web page to put together a list my favorite properties currently available 
	on the market that I have personally selected.  
	The name of my website AS Properties NYC stands for Ann&#39;s Selected Properties of New York City.</p><br>
	
	<p>If you are interested in selling your home, please contact me and I will list your home in 
	both the MLS and here on my personal AS Properties website to get you the best price and to get it 
	sold quickly.</p> <br>
	
	<p>If you are interested in buying a home, please trust me to get you the best home available on the market.  
	We have access to all homes currently listed in the MLS.  If you see a home listed for sale anywhere, contact us 
	and we can setup a time for you to go and view the property, anywhere in New York City.</p><br>
	
	<p>If you are interested in renting an apartment, please check my personally selected list of apartments 
	currently available for rent on this website.  When you see an apartment that you like, click the &#34;request&#34;
	button to contact me to set up a time for you to view the apartment.  This list is updated daily, apartments 
	come and go quickly, so check back frequently for an updated listing.</p><br>
	
	<p>If you would like to rent out your own apartment.  Regardless whether the apartment is in a private house, 
	a coop/condo building, or a rent stabilized building -- contact me and I will get your apartment listed 
	on multiple sources to get it rented out quickly without any fees or charges to you.</p><br>
	
	<p>Thank you all for visiting my website.  Please feel free to contact me if you have any question or if 
	you need to buy, sell, rent, or rent out a home.  My contact information is below. </p><br>
